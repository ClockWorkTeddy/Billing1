# Billing1
Hello! Script is in Services/Script.sh file. 

Result is in file Result.txt.

Meaning code is in Services/BillingService.cs.

Coins spread accordingly rating, but if we have unspreaded coins at the end of emission, them go to the man with max rating. (For examle boris should have 7 coins, but 1 + 1 + 7 != 10, so boris obtained 8).
After script running we have 5 coins with the same long history, so i pick any one of them.
